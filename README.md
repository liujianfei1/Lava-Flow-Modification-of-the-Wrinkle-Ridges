# Lava-Flow-Modification-of-the-Wrinkle-Ridges
A collection of Python scripts for plotting wrinkle ridge topography and calculating geophysical parameters such as thickness, two-way travel time, loss tangent, and yield stress.
The scripts are used for generating cross-sections and various plots related to subsurface and surface structures.

## Scripts Description

- **Thcikness_v2.py**  
  Calculates the relationship between fill thickness and two-way travel time, and generates **Fig. 4** in the article.

- **loss_tangent.py**  
  Plots the loss tangent of four radar tracks, corresponding to **Fig. 5**.

- **皱脊横切面绘制_new.py**  
  Plots 18 cross-sections of wrinkle ridges and illustrates how parameters (width, height, and crater distance) vary with distance, producing **Figs. 6b–d**.

- **radar_elevation_v4.py**  
  Generates elevation profiles for four radar tracks, corresponding to **Fig. 7b**.

- **Cross_Elevation_v4.py**  
  Produces eight cross-sectional profiles of wrinkle ridges after Kriging interpolation, corresponding to **Fig. 7c**.
