# Lava-Flow-Modification-of-the-Wrinkle-Ridges
A collection of Python scripts for plotting wrinkle ridge topography and calculating geophysical parameters such as thickness, two-way travel time, loss tangent, and yield stress.
The scripts are used for generating cross-sections and various plots related to subsurface and surface structures.
