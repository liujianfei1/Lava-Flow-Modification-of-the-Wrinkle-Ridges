# Lava-Flow-Modification-of-the-Wrinkle-Ridges
A collection of Python scripts for plotting wrinkle ridge topography and calculating geophysical parameters such as thickness, two-way travel time, loss tangent, and yield stress.
The scripts are used for generating cross-sections and various plots related to subsurface and surface structures.

## Scripts Overview


`Thcikness_v2.py` is used to calculate the relationship between fill thickness and two-way travel time, and will produce Fig. 4 in the article.

`loss_tangent.py`	is used to plot the loss tangent, and will produce Fig. 5.

`皱脊横切面绘制_new.py`	is used to plot 18 cross-sections of wrinkle ridges with parameters (width, height, distance from crater), and will produce Fig. 6b-d.

`radar_elevation_v4.py`	is used to generate elevation profiles for four radar tracks, and will produce Fig. 7b.	Fig. 7b

`Cross_Elevation_v4.py`	is used to generate 8 cross-sectional profiles of wrinkle ridges with Kriging interpolation, and will produce Fig. 7c.	Fig. 7c
